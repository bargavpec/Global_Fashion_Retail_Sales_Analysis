## Installation Guide

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python 3.8+ installed. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-fashion-retail-sales.git
   cd global-fashion-retail-sales
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the dataset and place it in the `/data` directory (see [Data Sources](#data-sources)).

5. Run the project:
   You can run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to begin your analysis. For example:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Data Sources

The primary data sources for this project include:
- Global fashion retail sales data from [source name] (e.g., Statista, Euromonitor, etc.).
- Consumer behavior data from [source name].
- Market segmentation data from [source name].

## Usage

### 1. Sales Data Analysis
Run `notebooks/sales_analysis.ipynb` to analyze the sales data, including:
- Revenue analysis by region
- Year-over-year growth trends
- Product category performance

### 2. Forecasting Future Sales
The forecasting module in `scripts/forecasting.py` uses machine learning algorithms to predict sales trends for the next quarters. 

```python
from forecasting import forecast_sales

# Predict sales for the next quarter
forecast_sales(data)
```

### 3. Consumer Insights
Run `notebooks/consumer_behavior.ipynb` to generate insights on consumer preferences, focusing on demographic factors, fashion styles, and spending habits.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning for forecasting.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive data exploration.
- **SQL**: Querying relational databases (if applicable).

## Results

The analysis reveals the following key insights:
1. **Growth**: The global fashion retail market grew by X% over the past Y years, with significant growth in region A.
2. **Trends**: The most popular fashion trends in Q1 2025 include sustainable fashion and athleisure.
3. **Consumer Insights**: Consumers in region A tend to favor luxury brands, while region B shows a preference for affordable, fast fashion.
4. **Forecasting**: Based on current trends, the fashion retail industry is expected to grow by Z% in the next 12 months.
